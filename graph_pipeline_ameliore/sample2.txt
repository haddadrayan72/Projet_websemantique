Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It has become one of the most important technologies in data science. Algorithms like decision trees, support vector machines, and deep learning networks are commonly used. Applications include image recognition, medical diagnosis, and recommendation systems.
